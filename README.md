# Youtube_Scraper

<h2> What is this? </h2>

This is a small project written to demonstrate how to scrap YouTube without using the Youtube API. The purpose of the project is to visually show how you can scrape sites and save the resulting ones to a file.

<h2> How it works? </h2>

This is what the application looks like with the basic interface:

You enter some name and title and press Scrape. The application does a search for this name and selects the first video that Google will give out, and then scrapes and displays its data.

Then you can click Save and save the received data to an Excel file:

<h2> How can it be used? </h2>

The scraping method in this project shows that we can scrape not only simple sites, but also those that save all the basic information in the Script, which complicates the task. It also shows how convenient it is to save data in the form you need and make scraping applications more convenient. For example, if we add a couple of features, the user can choose how many videos they want to scrape into one file, or even choose which videos they want to scrape.

The number of videos for scraping is unlimited.
